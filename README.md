Abstract
========

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) full system emulator, 
  using the [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) hypervisor
  (also known as a VM accelerator)
* [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) guest OS

The docker container holds a recent [Debian Linux]() image with all the
necessary tools to build and run the [QEMU]() full system emulator.  In turn
QEMU drives a Debian Linux generic cloud image

Functional Requirements
=======================

Development environment
* portable
* stable
* flexible
* repeatable

Functional Overview
===================
This project has three major components:
* a docker container
* a qemu

QEMU VM

QEMU Guest Image

File Descriptions
=================
* README.md: this file
* bashlib.sh: library of bash scripts for running docker container and qemu image
* env_vars: bash source file to set environment variables used in `bashlib.sh`
* qemu.Dockerfile: dockerfile to create the docker image
* bashrc.docker: custom bashrc copied to docker image (see `qemu.Dockerfile`)
* user-data.yaml
* metadata.yaml 
* `id_qemu_dummy.key`: example RSA PKE file for ssh access to QEMU guest VM

Additionally some files and directories are created:
* `$Q_P` is generated by `bashlib.sh:q_p_bld`. The `qemu.git` repo is assumed
  to be cloned and branched on a tag.
* The desired debian generic cloud image will be pulled from the official
  debian site by `bashlib.sh:qemu_get_debian_cloud` and converted to a local
  copy.
* See `bashlib.sh` for log files including LOG.CONFIG.QEMU and
  $Q_TOP/build/meson-logs/meson-log.txt
